SHORE:	Smart HO Railroad Environment

SHORE is an attempt to provide a level of intelligence to a HO-gauge model railroad.

It uses WIFI controls for the switches, signals, sensors, and engines where the sensors are embedded in the
track.	The control for the switches, signals and sensors is a personal hardware/software (arduino) project.
